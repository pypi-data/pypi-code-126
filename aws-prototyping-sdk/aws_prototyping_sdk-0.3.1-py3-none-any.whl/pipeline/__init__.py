'''
The pipeline module vends an extension to CDK's CodePipeline construct, named PDKPipeline. It additionally creates a CodeCommit repository and by default is configured to build the project assumming nx-monorepo is being used (although this can be changed). A Sonarqube Scanner can also be configured to trigger a scan whenever the synth build job completes successfully. This Scanner is non-blocking and as such is not instrumented as part of the pipeline.

The architecture for the PDKPipeline is as follows:

```
CodeCommit repository -> CodePipeline
                             |-> EventBridge Rule (On Build Succeded) -> CodeBuild (Sonar Scan)
                             |-> Secret (sonarqube token)
```

This module additionally vends multiple Projen Projects, one for each of the supported languages. These projects aim to bootstrap your project by providing sample code which uses the PDKPipeline construct.

For example, in .projenrc.ts:

```python
new PDKPipelineTsProject({
    cdkVersion: "2.1.0",
    defaultReleaseBranch: "mainline",
    devDeps: ["aws-prototyping-sdk"],
    name: "my-pipeline",
});
```

This will generate a package in typescript containing CDK boilerplate for a pipeline stack (which instantiates PDKPipeline), sets up a Dev stage with an Application Stage containing an empty ApplicationStack (to be implemented). Once this package is synthesized, you can run `npx projen` and projen will synthesize your cloudformation.

Alternatively, you can initialize a project using the cli (in an empty directory) for each of the supported languages as follows:

```bash
# Typescript
npx projen new --from aws-prototyping-sdk pdk-pipeline-ts
```

```bash
# Python
npx projen new --from aws-prototyping-sdk pdk-pipeline-py
```

```bash
# Java
npx projen new --from aws-prototyping-sdk pdk-pipeline-java
```

        :param scope: -
        :param id: -
        :param primary_synth_directory: Output directory for cdk synthesized artifacts i.e: packages/infra/cdk.out.
        :param repository_name: Name of the CodeCommit repository to create.
        :param code_commit_removal_policy: Possible values for a resource's Removal Policy The removal policy controls what happens to the resource if it stops being managed by CloudFormation.
        :param default_branch_name: Branch to trigger the pipeline execution. Default: mainline
        :param sonar_code_scanner_config: Configuration for enabling Sonarqube code scanning on a successful synth. Default: undefined
        :param synth_shell_step_partial_props: PDKPipeline by default assumes a NX Monorepo structure for it's codebase and uses sane defaults for the install and run commands. To override these defaults and/or provide additional inputs, specify env settings, etc you can provide a partial ShellStepProps.
        :param synth: The build step that produces the CDK Cloud Assembly. The primary output of this step needs to be the ``cdk.out`` directory generated by the ``cdk synth`` command. If you use a ``ShellStep`` here and you don't configure an output directory, the output directory will automatically be assumed to be ``cdk.out``.
        :param asset_publishing_code_build_defaults: Additional customizations to apply to the asset publishing CodeBuild projects. Default: - Only ``codeBuildDefaults`` are applied
        :param cli_version: CDK CLI version to use in self-mutation and asset publishing steps. If you want to lock the CDK CLI version used in the pipeline, by steps that are automatically generated for you, specify the version here. We recommend you do not specify this value, as not specifying it always uses the latest CLI version which is backwards compatible with old versions. If you do specify it, be aware that this version should always be equal to or higher than the version of the CDK framework used by the CDK app, when the CDK commands are run during your pipeline execution. When you change this version, the *next time* the ``SelfMutate`` step runs it will still be using the CLI of the the *previous* version that was in this property: it will only start using the new version after ``SelfMutate`` completes successfully. That means that if you want to update both framework and CLI version, you should update the CLI version first, commit, push and deploy, and only then update the framework version. Default: - Latest version
        :param code_build_defaults: Customize the CodeBuild projects created for this pipeline. Default: - All projects run non-privileged build, SMALL instance, LinuxBuildImage.STANDARD_5_0
        :param code_pipeline: An existing Pipeline to be reused and built upon. [disable-awslint:ref-via-interface] Default: - a new underlying pipeline is created.
        :param cross_account_keys: Create KMS keys for the artifact buckets, allowing cross-account deployments. The artifact buckets have to be encrypted to support deploying CDK apps to another account, so if you want to do that or want to have your artifact buckets encrypted, be sure to set this value to ``true``. Be aware there is a cost associated with maintaining the KMS keys. Default: false
        :param docker_credentials: A list of credentials used to authenticate to Docker registries. Specify any credentials necessary within the pipeline to build, synth, update, or publish assets. Default: []
        :param docker_enabled_for_self_mutation: Enable Docker for the self-mutate step. Set this to true if the pipeline itself uses Docker container assets (for example, if you use ``LinuxBuildImage.fromAsset()`` as the build image of a CodeBuild step in the pipeline). You do not need to set it if you build Docker image assets in the application Stages and Stacks that are *deployed* by this pipeline. Configures privileged mode for the self-mutation CodeBuild action. If you are about to turn this on in an already-deployed Pipeline, set the value to ``true`` first, commit and allow the pipeline to self-update, and only then use the Docker asset in the pipeline. Default: false
        :param docker_enabled_for_synth: Enable Docker for the 'synth' step. Set this to true if you are using file assets that require "bundling" anywhere in your application (meaning an asset compilation step will be run with the tools provided by a Docker image), both for the Pipeline stack as well as the application stacks. A common way to use bundling assets in your application is by using the ``@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-nodejs`` library. Configures privileged mode for the synth CodeBuild action. If you are about to turn this on in an already-deployed Pipeline, set the value to ``true`` first, commit and allow the pipeline to self-update, and only then use the bundled asset. Default: false
        :param pipeline_name: The name of the CodePipeline pipeline. Default: - Automatically generated
        :param publish_assets_in_parallel: Publish assets in multiple CodeBuild projects. If set to false, use one Project per type to publish all assets. Publishing in parallel improves concurrency and may reduce publishing latency, but may also increase overall provisioning time of the CodeBuild projects. Experiment and see what value works best for you. Default: true
        :param reuse_cross_region_support_stacks: Reuse the same cross region support stack for all pipelines in the App. Default: - true (Use the same support stack for all pipelines in App)
        :param self_mutation: Whether the pipeline will update itself. This needs to be set to ``true`` to allow the pipeline to reconfigure itself when assets or stages are being added to it, and ``true`` is the recommended setting. You can temporarily set this to ``false`` while you are iterating on the pipeline itself and prefer to deploy changes using ``cdk deploy``. Default: true
        :param self_mutation_code_build_defaults: Additional customizations to apply to the self mutation CodeBuild projects. Default: - Only ``codeBuildDefaults`` are applied
        :param synth_code_build_defaults: Additional customizations to apply to the synthesize CodeBuild projects. Default: - Only ``codeBuildDefaults`` are applied

        :param cdk_dependencies: (deprecated) Which AWS CDKv1 modules this project requires.
        :param cdk_dependencies_as_deps: (deprecated) If this is enabled (default), all modules declared in ``cdkDependencies`` will be also added as normal ``dependencies`` (as well as ``peerDependencies``). This is to ensure that downstream consumers actually have your CDK dependencies installed when using npm < 7 or yarn, where peer dependencies are not automatically installed. If this is disabled, ``cdkDependencies`` will be added to ``devDependencies`` to ensure they are present during development. Note: this setting only applies to construct library projects Default: true
        :param cdk_test_dependencies: (deprecated) AWS CDK modules required for testing.
        :param cdk_version_pinning: (experimental) Use pinned version instead of caret version for CDK. You can use this to prevent mixed versions for your CDK dependencies and to prevent auto-updates. If you use experimental features this will let you define the moment you include breaking changes.
        :param constructs_version: (experimental) Minimum version of the ``constructs`` library to depend on. Default: - for CDK 1.x the default is "3.2.27", for CDK 2.x the default is "10.0.5".

        :param projen_credentials: (experimental) Choose a method of providing GitHub API access for projen workflows. Default: - use a personal access token named PROJEN_GITHUB_TOKEN
        :param projen_token_secret: (deprecated) The name of a secret which includes a GitHub Personal Access Token to be used by projen workflows. This token needs to have the ``repo``, ``workflows`` and ``packages`` scope. Default: "PROJEN_GITHUB_TOKEN"
        :param readme: (experimental) The README setup. Default: - { filename: 'README.md', contents: '# replace this' }
        :param stale: (experimental) Auto-close of stale issues and pull request. See ``staleOptions`` for options. Default: false
        :param stale_options: (experimental) Auto-close stale issues and pull requests. To disable set ``stale`` to ``false``. Default: - see defaults in ``StaleOptions``
        :param vscode: (experimental) Enable VSCode integration. Enabled by default for root projects. Disabled for non-root projects. Default: true
        :param artifact_id: (experimental) The artifactId is generally the name that the project is known by. Although the groupId is important, people within the group will rarely mention the groupId in discussion (they are often all be the same ID, such as the MojoHaus project groupId: org.codehaus.mojo). It, along with the groupId, creates a key that separates this project from every other project in the world (at least, it should :) ). Along with the groupId, the artifactId fully defines the artifact's living quarters within the repository. In the case of the above project, my-project lives in $M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo/my-project. Default: "my-app"
        :param group_id: (experimental) This is generally unique amongst an organization or a project. For example, all core Maven artifacts do (well, should) live under the groupId org.apache.maven. Group ID's do not necessarily use the dot notation, for example, the junit project. Note that the dot-notated groupId does not have to correspond to the package structure that the project contains. It is, however, a good practice to follow. When stored within a repository, the group acts much like the Java packaging structure does in an operating system. The dots are replaced by OS specific directory separators (such as '/' in Unix) which becomes a relative directory structure from the base repository. In the example given, the org.codehaus.mojo group lives within the directory $M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo. Default: "org.acme"
        :param version: (experimental) This is the last piece of the naming puzzle. groupId:artifactId denotes a single project but they cannot delineate which incarnation of that project we are talking about. Do we want the junit:junit of 2018 (version 4.12), or of 2007 (version 3.8.2)? In short: code changes, those changes should be versioned, and this element keeps those versions in line. It is also used within an artifact's repository to separate versions from each other. my-project version 1.0 files live in the directory structure $M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo/my-project/1.0. Default: "0.1.0"
        :param description: (experimental) Description of a project is always good. Although this should not replace formal documentation, a quick comment to any readers of the POM is always helpful. Default: undefined
        :param packaging: (experimental) Project packaging format. Default: "jar"

        :param renovatebot: (experimental) Use renovatebot to handle dependency upgrades. Default: false
        :param renovatebot_options: (experimental) Options for renovatebot. Default: - default options
        :param auto_approve_options: (experimental) Enable and configure the 'auto approve' workflow. Default: - auto approve is disabled
        :param auto_merge: (experimental) Enable automatic merging on GitHub. Has no effect if ``github.mergify`` is set to false. Default: true
        :param auto_merge_options: (experimental) Configure options for automatic merging on GitHub. Has no effect if ``github.mergify`` or ``autoMerge`` is set to false. Default: - see defaults in ``AutoMergeOptions``
        :param clobber: (experimental) Add a ``clobber`` task which resets the repo to origin. Default: true
        :param dev_container: (experimental) Add a VSCode development environment (used for GitHub Codespaces). Default: false
        :param github: (experimental) Enable GitHub integration. Enabled by default for root projects. Disabled for non-root projects. Default: true
        :param github_options: (experimental) Options for GitHub integration. Default: - see GitHubOptions
        :param gitpod: (experimental) Add a Gitpod development environment. Default: false
        :param mergify: (deprecated) Whether mergify should be enabled on this repository or not. Default: true
        :param mergify_options: (deprecated) Options for mergify. Default: - default options
        :param project_type: (deprecated) Which type of project this is (library/app). Default: ProjectType.UNKNOWN
        :param projen_credentials: (experimental) Choose a method of providing GitHub API access for projen workflows. Default: - use a personal access token named PROJEN_GITHUB_TOKEN
        :param projen_token_secret: (deprecated) The name of a secret which includes a GitHub Personal Access Token to be used by projen workflows. This token needs to have the ``repo``, ``workflows`` and ``packages`` scope. Default: "PROJEN_GITHUB_TOKEN"
        :param readme: (experimental) The README setup. Default: - { filename: 'README.md', contents: '# replace this' }
        :param stale: (experimental) Auto-close of stale issues and pull request. See ``staleOptions`` for options. Default: false
        :param stale_options: (experimental) Auto-close stale issues and pull requests. To disable set ``stale`` to ``false``. Default: - see defaults in ``StaleOptions``
        :param vscode: (experimental) Enable VSCode integration. Enabled by default for root projects. Disabled for non-root projects. Default: true
        :param artifact_id: (experimental) The artifactId is generally the name that the project is known by. Although the groupId is important, people within the group will rarely mention the groupId in discussion (they are often all be the same ID, such as the MojoHaus project groupId: org.codehaus.mojo). It, along with the groupId, creates a key that separates this project from every other project in the world (at least, it should :) ). Along with the groupId, the artifactId fully defines the artifact's living quarters within the repository. In the case of the above project, my-project lives in $M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo/my-project. Default: "my-app"
        :param group_id: (experimental) This is generally unique amongst an organization or a project. For example, all core Maven artifacts do (well, should) live under the groupId org.apache.maven. Group ID's do not necessarily use the dot notation, for example, the junit project. Note that the dot-notated groupId does not have to correspond to the package structure that the project contains. It is, however, a good practice to follow. When stored within a repository, the group acts much like the Java packaging structure does in an operating system. The dots are replaced by OS specific directory separators (such as '/' in Unix) which becomes a relative directory structure from the base repository. In the example given, the org.codehaus.mojo group lives within the directory $M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo. Default: "org.acme"
        :param version: (experimental) This is the last piece of the naming puzzle. groupId:artifactId denotes a single project but they cannot delineate which incarnation of that project we are talking about. Do we want the junit:junit of 2018 (version 4.12), or of 2007 (version 3.8.2)? In short: code changes, those changes should be versioned, and this element keeps those versions in line. It is also used within an artifact's repository to separate versions from each other. my-project version 1.0 files live in the directory structure $M2_REPO/org/codehaus/mojo/my-project/1.0. Default: "0.1.0"
        :param description: (experimental) Description of a project is always good. Although this should not replace formal documentation, a quick comment to any readers of the POM is always helpful. Default: undefined
        :param packaging: (experimental) Project packaging format. Default: "jar"
        :param url: (experimental) The URL, like the name, is not required. This is a nice gesture for projects users, however, so that they know where the project lives. Default: undefined
        :param compile_options: (experimental) Compile options. Default: - defaults
        :param deps: (experimental) List of runtime dependencies for this project. Dependencies use the format: ``<groupId>/<artifactId>@<semver>`` Additional dependencies can be added via ``project.addDependency()``. Default: []
        :param distdir: (experimental) Final artifact output directory. Default: "dist/java"
        :param junit: (experimental) Include junit tests. Default: true
        :param junit_options: (experimental) junit options. Default: - defaults
        :param packaging_options: (experimental) Packaging options. Default: - defaults
        :param projenrc_java: (experimental) Use projenrc in java. This will install ``projen`` as a java dependency and will add a ``synth`` task which will compile & execute ``main()`` from ``src/main/java/projenrc.java``. Default: true
        :param projenrc_java_options: (experimental) Options related to projenrc in java. Default: - default options
        :param test_deps: (experimental) List of test dependencies for this project. Dependencies use the format: ``<groupId>/<artifactId>@<semver>`` Additional dependencies can be added via ``project.addTestDependency()``. Default: []
        :param sample: (experimental) Include sample code and test if the relevant directories don't exist. Default: true
        :param sample_java_package: (experimental) The java package to use for the code sample. Default: "org.acme"
        :param build_command: (experimental) A command to execute before synthesis. This command will be called when running ``cdk synth`` or when ``cdk watch`` identifies a change in your source code before redeployment. Default: - no build command
        :param cdkout: (experimental) cdk.out directory. Default: "cdk.out"
        :param context: (experimental) Additional context to include in ``cdk.json``. Default: - no additional context
        :param feature_flags: (experimental) Include all feature flags in cdk.json. Default: true
        :param require_approval: (experimental) To protect you against unintended changes that affect your security posture, the AWS CDK Toolkit prompts you to approve security-related changes before deploying them. Default: ApprovalLevel.BROADENING
        :param watch_excludes: (experimental) Glob patterns to exclude from ``cdk watch``. Default: []
        :param watch_includes: (experimental) Glob patterns to include in ``cdk watch``. Default: []
        :param cdk_version: (experimental) Minimum version of the AWS CDK to depend on. Default: "2.1.0"
        :param cdk_assert: (deprecated) Warning: NodeJS only. Install the @aws-cdk/assert library? Default: - will be included by default for AWS CDK >= 1.0.0 < 2.0.0
        :param cdk_assertions: (experimental) Install the assertions library? Only needed for CDK 1.x. If using CDK 2.x then assertions is already included in 'aws-cdk-lib' Default: - will be included by default for AWS CDK >= 1.111.0 < 2.0.0
        :param cdk_dependencies: (deprecated) Which AWS CDKv1 modules this project requires.
        :param cdk_dependencies_as_deps: (deprecated) If this is enabled (default), all modules declared in ``cdkDependencies`` will be also added as normal ``dependencies`` (as well as ``peerDependencies``). This is to ensure that downstream consumers actually have your CDK dependencies installed when using npm < 7 or yarn, where peer dependencies are not automatically installed. If this is disabled, ``cdkDependencies`` will be added to ``devDependencies`` to ensure they are present during development. Note: this setting only applies to construct library projects Default: true
        :param cdk_test_dependencies: (deprecated) AWS CDK modules required for testing.
        :param cdk_version_pinning: (experimental) Use pinned version instead of caret version for CDK. You can use this to prevent mixed versions for your CDK dependencies and to prevent auto-updates. If you use experimental features this will let you define the moment you include breaking changes.
        :param constructs_version: (experimental) Minimum version of the ``constructs`` library to depend on. Default: - for CDK 1.x the default is "3.2.27", for CDK 2.x the default is "10.0.5".
        :param main_class: (experimental) The name of the Java class with the static ``main()`` method. This method should call ``app.synth()`` on the CDK app. Default: "org.acme.MyApp"

        the synth, synthShellStepPartialProps.input and
        synthShellStepPartialProps.primaryOutputDirectory properties will be ignored
        if passed in to this construct.

        synthShellStepPartialProps.commands is marked as a required field, however
        if you pass in [] the default commands of this construct will be retained.

        :param synth: The build step that produces the CDK Cloud Assembly. The primary output of this step needs to be the ``cdk.out`` directory generated by the ``cdk synth`` command. If you use a ``ShellStep`` here and you don't configure an output directory, the output directory will automatically be assumed to be ``cdk.out``.
        :param asset_publishing_code_build_defaults: Additional customizations to apply to the asset publishing CodeBuild projects. Default: - Only ``codeBuildDefaults`` are applied
        :param cli_version: CDK CLI version to use in self-mutation and asset publishing steps. If you want to lock the CDK CLI version used in the pipeline, by steps that are automatically generated for you, specify the version here. We recommend you do not specify this value, as not specifying it always uses the latest CLI version which is backwards compatible with old versions. If you do specify it, be aware that this version should always be equal to or higher than the version of the CDK framework used by the CDK app, when the CDK commands are run during your pipeline execution. When you change this version, the *next time* the ``SelfMutate`` step runs it will still be using the CLI of the the *previous* version that was in this property: it will only start using the new version after ``SelfMutate`` completes successfully. That means that if you want to update both framework and CLI version, you should update the CLI version first, commit, push and deploy, and only then update the framework version. Default: - Latest version
        :param code_build_defaults: Customize the CodeBuild projects created for this pipeline. Default: - All projects run non-privileged build, SMALL instance, LinuxBuildImage.STANDARD_5_0
        :param code_pipeline: An existing Pipeline to be reused and built upon. [disable-awslint:ref-via-interface] Default: - a new underlying pipeline is created.
        :param cross_account_keys: Create KMS keys for the artifact buckets, allowing cross-account deployments. The artifact buckets have to be encrypted to support deploying CDK apps to another account, so if you want to do that or want to have your artifact buckets encrypted, be sure to set this value to ``true``. Be aware there is a cost associated with maintaining the KMS keys. Default: false
        :param docker_credentials: A list of credentials used to authenticate to Docker registries. Specify any credentials necessary within the pipeline to build, synth, update, or publish assets. Default: []
        :param docker_enabled_for_self_mutation: Enable Docker for the self-mutate step. Set this to true if the pipeline itself uses Docker container assets (for example, if you use ``LinuxBuildImage.fromAsset()`` as the build image of a CodeBuild step in the pipeline). You do not need to set it if you build Docker image assets in the application Stages and Stacks that are *deployed* by this pipeline. Configures privileged mode for the self-mutation CodeBuild action. If you are about to turn this on in an already-deployed Pipeline, set the value to ``true`` first, commit and allow the pipeline to self-update, and only then use the Docker asset in the pipeline. Default: false
        :param docker_enabled_for_synth: Enable Docker for the 'synth' step. Set this to true if you are using file assets that require "bundling" anywhere in your application (meaning an asset compilation step will be run with the tools provided by a Docker image), both for the Pipeline stack as well as the application stacks. A common way to use bundling assets in your application is by using the ``@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-nodejs`` library. Configures privileged mode for the synth CodeBuild action. If you are about to turn this on in an already-deployed Pipeline, set the value to ``true`` first, commit and allow the pipeline to self-update, and only then use the bundled asset. Default: false
        :param pipeline_name: The name of the CodePipeline pipeline. Default: - Automatically generated
        :param publish_assets_in_parallel: Publish assets in multiple CodeBuild projects. If set to false, use one Project per type to publish all assets. Publishing in parallel improves concurrency and may reduce publishing latency, but may also increase overall provisioning time of the CodeBuild projects. Experiment and see what value works best for you. Default: true
        :param reuse_cross_region_support_stacks: Reuse the same cross region support stack for all pipelines in the App. Default: - true (Use the same support stack for all pipelines in App)
        :param self_mutation: Whether the pipeline will update itself. This needs to be set to ``true`` to allow the pipeline to reconfigure itself when assets or stages are being added to it, and ``true`` is the recommended setting. You can temporarily set this to ``false`` while you are iterating on the pipeline itself and prefer to deploy changes using ``cdk deploy``. Default: true
        :param self_mutation_code_build_defaults: Additional customizations to apply to the self mutation CodeBuild projects. Default: - Only ``codeBuildDefaults`` are applied
        :param synth_code_build_defaults: Additional customizations to apply to the synthesize CodeBuild projects. Default: - Only ``codeBuildDefaults`` are applied
        :param primary_synth_directory: Output directory for cdk synthesized artifacts i.e: packages/infra/cdk.out.
        :param repository_name: Name of the CodeCommit repository to create.
        :param code_commit_removal_policy: Possible values for a resource's Removal Policy The removal policy controls what happens to the resource if it stops being managed by CloudFormation.
        :param default_branch_name: Branch to trigger the pipeline execution. Default: mainline
        :param sonar_code_scanner_config: Configuration for enabling Sonarqube code scanning on a successful synth. Default: undefined
        :param synth_shell_step_partial_props: PDKPipeline by default assumes a NX Monorepo structure for it's codebase and uses sane defaults for the install and run commands. To override these defaults and/or provide additional inputs, specify env settings, etc you can provide a partial ShellStepProps.

The recommendation is to only specify the module name here (e.g. ``express``). This will behave similar to ``yarn add`` or ``npm install`` in the sense that it will add the module as a dependency to your ``package.json`` file with the latest version (``^``).

        :param npm_registry_url: (experimental) The base URL of the npm package registry. Must be a URL (e.g. start with "https://" or "http://") Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org"
        :param npm_token_secret: (experimental) GitHub secret which contains the NPM token to use when publishing packages. Default: "NPM_TOKEN"
        :param package_manager: (experimental) The Node Package Manager used to execute scripts. Default: NodePackageManager.YARN
        :param package_name: (experimental) The "name" in package.json. Default: - defaults to project name
        :param peer_dependency_options: (experimental) Options for ``peerDeps``.
        :param peer_deps: (experimental) Peer dependencies for this module. Dependencies listed here are required to be installed (and satisfied) by the *consumer* of this library. Using peer dependencies allows you to ensure that only a single module of a certain library exists in the ``node_modules`` tree of your consumers. Note that prior to npm@7, peer dependencies are *not* automatically installed, which means that adding peer dependencies to a library will be a breaking change for your customers. Unless ``peerDependencyOptions.pinnedDevDependency`` is disabled (it is enabled by default), projen will automatically add a dev dependency with a pinned version for each peer dependency. This will ensure that you build & test your module against the lowest peer version required. Default: []
        :param repository: (experimental) The repository is the location where the actual code for your package lives. See https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json/#toc-repository
        :param repository_directory: (experimental) If the package.json for your package is not in the root directory (for example if it is part of a monorepo), you can specify the directory in which it lives.
        :param scoped_packages_options: (experimental) Options for privately hosted scoped packages. Default: - fetch all scoped packages from the public npm registry
        :param scripts: (experimental) npm scripts to include. If a script has the same name as a standard script, the standard script will be overwritten. Default: {}
        :param stability: (experimental) Package's Stability.
        :param jsii_release_version: (experimental) Version requirement of ``publib`` which is used to publish modules to npm. Default: "latest"
        :param major_version: (experimental) Major version to release from the default branch. If this is specified, we bump the latest version of this major version line. If not specified, we bump the global latest version. Default: - Major version is not enforced.
        :param npm_dist_tag: (experimental) The npmDistTag to use when publishing from the default branch. To set the npm dist-tag for release branches, set the ``npmDistTag`` property for each branch. Default: "latest"
        :param post_build_steps: (experimental) Steps to execute after build as part of the release workflow. Default: []
        :param prerelease: (experimental) Bump versions from the default branch as pre-releases (e.g. "beta", "alpha", "pre"). Default: - normal semantic versions
        :param publish_dry_run: (experimental) Instead of actually publishing to package managers, just print the publishing command. Default: false
        :param publish_tasks: (experimental) Define publishing tasks that can be executed manually as well as workflows. Normally, publishing only happens within automated workflows. Enable this in order to create a publishing task for each publishing activity. Default: false
        :param release_branches: (experimental) Defines additional release branches. A workflow will be created for each release branch which will publish releases from commits in this branch. Each release branch *must* be assigned a major version number which is used to enforce that versions published from that branch always use that major version. If multiple branches are used, the ``majorVersion`` field must also be provided for the default branch. Default: - no additional branches are used for release. you can use ``addBranch()`` to add additional branches.
        :param release_every_commit: (deprecated) Automatically release new versions every commit to one of branches in ``releaseBranches``. Default: true
        :param release_failure_issue: (experimental) Create a github issue on every failed publishing task. Default: false
        :param release_failure_issue_label: (experimental) The label to apply to issues indicating publish failures. Only applies if ``releaseFailureIssue`` is true. Default: "failed-release"
        :param release_schedule: (deprecated) CRON schedule to trigger new releases. Default: - no scheduled releases
        :param release_tag_prefix: (experimental) Automatically add the given prefix to release tags. Useful if you are releasing on multiple branches with overlapping version numbers. Note: this prefix is used to detect the latest tagged version when bumping, so if you change this on a project with an existing version history, you may need to manually tag your latest release with the new prefix. Default: - no prefix
        :param release_trigger: (experimental) The release trigger to use. Default: - Continuous releases (``ReleaseTrigger.continuous()``)
        :param release_workflow_name: (experimental) The name of the default release workflow. Default: "Release"
        :param release_workflow_setup_steps: (experimental) A set of workflow steps to execute in order to setup the workflow container.

        :param workflow_runs_on: (experimental) Github Runner selection labels. Default: ["ubuntu-latest"]
        :param name: (experimental) This is the name of your project. Default: $BASEDIR
        :param logging: (experimental) Configure logging options such as verbosity. Default: {}
        :param outdir: (experimental) The root directory of the project. Relative to this directory, all files are synthesized. If this project has a parent, this directory is relative to the parent directory and it cannot be the same as the parent or any of it's other sub-projects. Default: "."
        :param parent: (experimental) The parent project, if this project is part of a bigger project.
        :param projen_command: (experimental) The shell command to use in order to run the projen CLI. Can be used to customize in special environments. Default: "npx projen"
        :param projenrc_json: (experimental) Generate (once) .projenrc.json (in JSON). Set to ``false`` in order to disable .projenrc.json generation. Default: false
        :param projenrc_json_options: (experimental) Options for .projenrc.json. Default: - default options
        :param renovatebot: (experimental) Use renovatebot to handle dependency upgrades. Default: false

        :param description: (experimental) The description is just a string that helps people understand the purpose of the package. It can be used when searching for packages in a package manager as well. See https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json/#toc-description
        :param dev_deps: (experimental) Build dependencies for this module. These dependencies will only be available in your build environment but will not be fetched when this module is consumed. The recommendation is to only specify the module name here (e.g. ``express``). This will behave similar to ``yarn add`` or ``npm install`` in the sense that it will add the module as a dependency to your ``package.json`` file with the latest version (``^``). You can specify semver requirements in the same syntax passed to ``npm i`` or ``yarn add`` (e.g. ``express@^2``) and this will be what you ``package.json`` will eventually include. Default: []
        :param entrypoint: (experimental) Module entrypoint (``main`` in ``package.json``). Set to an empty string to not include ``main`` in your package.json Default: "lib/index.js"
        :param homepage: (experimental) Package's Homepage / Website.
        :param keywords: (experimental) Keywords to include in ``package.json``.
        :param license: (experimental) License's SPDX identifier. See https://github.com/projen/projen/tree/main/license-text for a list of supported licenses. Use the ``licensed`` option if you want to no license to be specified. Default: "Apache-2.0"

        :param max_node_version: (experimental) Minimum node.js version to require via ``engines`` (inclusive). Default: - no max
        :param min_node_version: (experimental) Minimum Node.js version to require via package.json ``engines`` (inclusive). Default: - no "engines" specified
        :param npm_access: (experimental) Access level of the npm package. Default: - for scoped packages (e.g. ``foo@bar``), the default is ``NpmAccess.RESTRICTED``, for non-scoped packages, the default is ``NpmAccess.PUBLIC``.
        :param npm_registry: (deprecated) The host name of the npm registry to publish to. Cannot be set together with ``npmRegistryUrl``.
        :param npm_registry_url: (experimental) The base URL of the npm package registry. Must be a URL (e.g. start with "https://" or "http://") Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org"
        :param npm_token_secret: (experimental) GitHub secret which contains the NPM token to use when publishing packages. Default: "NPM_TOKEN"

        :param package_name: (experimental) The "name" in package.json. Default: - defaults to project name
        :param peer_dependency_options: (experimental) Options for ``peerDeps``.
        :param peer_deps: (experimental) Peer dependencies for this module. Dependencies listed here are required to be installed (and satisfied) by the *consumer* of this library. Using peer dependencies allows you to ensure that only a single module of a certain library exists in the ``node_modules`` tree of your consumers. Note that prior to npm@7, peer dependencies are *not* automatically installed, which means that adding peer dependencies to a library will be a breaking change for your customers. Unless ``peerDependencyOptions.pinnedDevDependency`` is disabled (it is enabled by default), projen will automatically add a dev dependency with a pinned version for each peer dependency. This will ensure that you build & test your module against the lowest peer version required. Default: []
        :param repository: (experimental) The repository is the location where the actual code for your package lives. See https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/package-json/#toc-repository
        :param repository_directory: (experimental) If the package.json for your package is not in the root directory (for example if it is part of a monorepo), you can specify the directory in which it lives.
        :param scoped_packages_options: (experimental) Options for privately hosted scoped packages. Default: - fetch all scoped packages from the public npm registry
        :param scripts: (experimental) npm scripts to include. If a script has the same name as a standard script, the standard script will be overwritten. Default: {}
        :param stability: (experimental) Package's Stability.
        :param jsii_release_version: (experimental) Version requirement of ``publib`` which is used to publish modules to npm. Default: "latest"
        :param major_version: (experimental) Major version to release from the default branch. If this is specified, we bump the latest version of this major version line. If not specified, we bump the global latest version. Default: - Major version is not enforced.
        :param npm_dist_tag: (experimental) The npmDistTag to use when publishing from the default branch. To set the npm dist-tag for release branches, set the ``npmDistTag`` property for each branch. Default: "latest"
        :param post_build_steps: (experimental) Steps to execute after build as part of the release workflow. Default: []
        :param prerelease: (experimental) Bump versions from the default branch as pre-releases (e.g. "beta", "alpha", "pre"). Default: - normal semantic versions
        :param publish_dry_run: (experimental) Instead of actually publishing to package managers, just print the publishing command. Default: false
        :param publish_tasks: (experimental) Define publishing tasks that can be executed manually as well as workflows. Normally, publishing only happens within automated workflows. Enable this in order to create a publishing task for each publishing activity. Default: false
        :param release_branches: (experimental) Defines additional release branches. A workflow will be created for each release branch which will publish releases from commits in this branch. Each release branch *must* be assigned a major version number which is used to enforce that versions published from that branch always use that major version. If multiple branches are used, the ``majorVersion`` field must also be provided for the default branch. Default: - no additional branches are used for release. you can use ``addBranch()`` to add additional branches.
        :param release_every_commit: (deprecated) Automatically release new versions every commit to one of branches in ``releaseBranches``. Default: true
        :param release_failure_issue: (experimental) Create a github issue on every failed publishing task. Default: false
        :param release_failure_issue_label: (experimental) The label to apply to issues indicating publish failures. Only applies if ``releaseFailureIssue`` is true. Default: "failed-release"
        :param release_schedule: (deprecated) CRON schedule to trigger new releases. Default: - no scheduled releases
        :param release_tag_prefix: (experimental) Automatically add the given prefix to release tags. Useful if you are releasing on multiple branches with overlapping version numbers. Note: this prefix is used to detect the latest tagged version when bumping, so if you change this on a project with an existing version history, you may need to manually tag your latest release with the new prefix. Default: - no prefix
        :param release_trigger: (experimental) The release trigger to use. Default: - Continuous releases (``ReleaseTrigger.continuous()``)
        :param release_workflow_name: (experimental) The name of the default release workflow. Default: "Release"
        :param release_workflow_setup_steps: (experimental) A set of workflow steps to execute in order to setup the workflow container.
